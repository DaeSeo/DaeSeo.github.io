## Concept 1. 1

### *The study of life reveals unifying themes*

What is the life?
there are some of the properties and processes we associate with life.

1. Order
2. Evolutionary adaptation
3. Regulation
4. Energy Processing
5. Growth and development
6. Response to the environment
7. Reproduction

<br/>

Biology, the scientific study of life, is a subject of enormous scope, and exciting new biological discoveries are being made every day.

<br/>

Here are five unifying themes-ways of thinking about life that will still be useful decades from now.

1. Organization
2. Information
3. Energy and Matter
4. Interactions
5. Evolution

#### Theme: New Properties Emerge at Successive Levels of Biological Organization

The study of life on Earth extends from the microscopic scale of the molecules and cells that make up organisms to the global scale of the entire living planet.

from,
1. The Biosphere - Earth level
2. Ecosystems - Meadow level
3. Communities - Inhabit level
4. Populations - Species level
5. Organisms - living things level ex)plant, animal
6. Organs - Life Structure level
7. Tissues - Group of cells
8. Cells - fundamental unit of structure & function
9. Organelles - Components in cell
10. Molecules - Chemical structure


#### Strcutre and Function

Eukaryotic-cell(진핵세포) contains membrance(세포막)-enclosed organelles(세포 소기관)

Prokaryotic-cell(원핵세포) lacks a nucleus or other membrane-enclosed organelles

#### DNA, the Genetic Material

Each chromosome(염색체) contains one very long DNA molecule(분자) with hundreds or thousands of genes, each a section of the DNA of the chromosome.

A DNA molecule is made up of two long chains, called strands, arranged in a double helix(이중나선구조). Each chain is made up of four kinds of chemical building blocks called **nucleotides**, abbreviated A, T, C, and G

<br/>

The sequence of nucleotides along a gene is transcribed into mRNA, which is then **translated** into a linked series of protein building blocks called amino acids. Once completed, the amino acid chain forms a specific protein with a unique shape and function. The entire process by which the information in a gene directs the manufacture of a cellular product is called **gene_expression**
